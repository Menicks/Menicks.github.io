Heyy!!
Sup ?
Anyways I am Nikhil Mittal. I am currently doing Btech from Jamia Millia Islamia. 

Well let's talk about my personality ;)
I am a sensitive, understanding and supportive person.I mostly think of others before myself.I think I'm  friendly and approachable, if you know me you might agree.

I love keeping some secrets ;) its good to have secrets :D.

Coming to my hobbies I love music, I can't live without it, you can have a look at the artists I listen to at my Last.fm profile, [here](http://www.last.fm/user/nickedes).

^Will be writing more. :)
