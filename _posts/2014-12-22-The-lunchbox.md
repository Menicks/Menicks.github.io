This Saturday night I was just bored thinking what to do, then I decided to watch a movie ```The Lunchbox```.
 
Well the movie was awesome. After a long time I watched a movie that was worth time devoting and interesting too.

**SPOILER ALERT**

Before reading further, if you haven't watched the movie, then I would suggest you to watch it first, you may like it and then continue reading this post. By the way I doubt I have any readers at all :(.

#Ending
 
The movie has an open ending. 
 
When Mr. Fernandes took the train to Nasik he realised that he's not really old, so he returned back. **That's evident** when we see him travelling with the *dabbawalas* in the last few scenes.
 
Well, if you carefully see the movie and note the words of Ila's mother after her husband passed away, made Ila realise that she can't live the life her mom has lived. So the next day only Ila sells her jewellery and in hope of using the money to start her new life.
 
The movie ends with Ila starting a new life of her own choice with her child leaving behind her old life of a cheating husband and Mr. Fernandes discovers the joy of life once again. Also the words of Ila at the end convey that Mr. Fernandes can join them too.
 
The aspect that *sometimes a wrong train (or any mode of transport :P) may lead you to the correct place* :) is beautifully portrayed. Starting from **The Lunchbox** reaching the wrong person (Mr. Fernandes) till the end when Ila decides to give up her old life.
