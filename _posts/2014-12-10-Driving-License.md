So by the title i.e. "Driving Licence" you might be thinking that I will be writing about my license. Yes I will write about the day when I had tge driving license test.Lol it was a funny day for me.
So here it is..

It was a normal day I slept at 1 am and was sleeping till 9 am until my dad came and wake me up saying its your holiday today , we can go for your driving license test. Well I didn't want to go but I had no excuses left.
So we were go for the test, I passed the initial test earlier , that was a LOL test anybody who had knowledge of traffic rules could easily pass it.
But that day I was going for driving test where I had to drive the car which I was not confident about. 

So after waiting for 1 hour and filling all the forms , I was in the car  and  on my left was the person who took my test. His name was Andrew and looked scary to me though he was smiling when i was sitting , don't know why.
I started the car and in first try only I was unable to start it and Mr. Andrew kept laughing on me after 1-2 more trials I was able to start the car , the problem was that I wore shoes and pressed brake instead of the clutch,generally i wear sandals while driving.

Andrew was still continously seeing me and had a smile on his face and I saw he was writing something on his paper related to belt. FUCK my seat belt.....I stopped the car immediately and put on belt and now he was laughing hard obviously on my state :/ , but he appreciated that I stopped the car.

This 10 minutes journey in the car was one of the most weird ones in my life

Read on...

Seat belt done , car started what next ?...next is a U turn baby Woah!! I took a sexy U turn. Moving further was the end of the road and he said now u have take back from here to where we started. Oh god I don't know how to take a back or reverse whatever it is, I thought let's be smarter and as I will reach the end I will take a turn but sadly I was unable to do so. Now I was stuck. 
What will I do now? ....Someone save me!!

And then Andrew said **move out of the car boy**. A thought came to my mind that he will fail me, failing means giving all the tests again, filling those infinte no. of forms again and again and blah blah balh!!! surely I CAN'T take this shit again, lets do it thinking ```jo hoga dekha jayega```  So I pressed the clutch put in reverse gear and then moved car backwards changed the gear and immediately took a turn and then back on track :D. Woah!!! Having a big smile on my face and then we returned to where we started ...though I am still amazed how was I able to take a reverse because I still cant :3.

Definitely Andrew was amazed.

So my test finished and obviously I didn't fail.

My dad who thought i will definitely fail because according to him i can't drive.

P.S: More to come.

P.P.S: Don't expect me to be perfect because there is no fun in being perfect! :P
