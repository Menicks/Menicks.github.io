## Morning
23rd December,Tuesday 3:30 am in the morning, I asked my mum and dad to wake up. Till 4 am everyone was awake. Well, I didn't sleep some credit goes to Mr. [Rana](https://www.facebook.com/TrigonaMinima), want to know more ask him :P. 

Till 5 am everyone was ready for going, we were just waiting for the taxi. Within few minutes taxi came and we left the house for Jaipur. Yay! Don't know about others, but I was excited for this trip because I just love travelling in winters and that too with family. 

When we came out of the house, it was biting cold and fog. Yeah, very cold and very pleasant. 

At around 5:30 am we reached the *New Delhi Railway station*. It felt good to  with coolies and passengers all around. The arrival time of the train was 6 am , so we were just waiting for the train in cold *shivering*. 

So the train **Ajmer Shatabdi express** arrived at 5:55 am Lol *before time*, I thought it would be late but No. So the train started moving within 10 minutes. 

Well, we were offered many things in the train

1. Newspaper

2. lemon juice

3. Water bottle

4. Breakfast

Well, my train journey passed by sleeping, chatting, watching out and some muusik.

We reached Jaipur by 11 am and hotel by 11:30 am. The hotel was nice and the rooms were quite spacious. Without wasting much time we left the hotel for our trip :).

After listening to some *Potter's* tracks I went to sleep.
